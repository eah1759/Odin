    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta is pasta. The name is an inside joke. I am not implying that this pasta is alcoholic in any way. It's quite a soupy pasta though.</p>
    <p>Credit where credit is due, this recipe is taken from a bee.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Chopped Celery</li>
        <li>Chopped Onions</li>
        <li>Chopped/Sliced Carrots</li>
        <li>0.5-1.5 Pounds Ground Beef</li>
        <li>60oz Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>1 Pound Linguine/Fettucini Pasta</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the chopped vegetables in a pot.</li>
        <li>Cover the mixture in olive oil (Enough that all the vegetables have oil over them but not enough that there is a pool of oil).</li>
        <li>Fry the mixture on medium high heat until soft and brown.</li>
        <li>Put in the ground beef and some salt into the mixture (Make sure to break up the ground beef).</li>
        <li>While the meat cooks, boil a pot of water.</li>
        <li>When the water is boiling, add the pasta into it to cook.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is browned, put all the tomato sauce into the mixture.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is done, drain it and add it to the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
