# The Odin Project - Foundations: Project: Recipes

This is the first project in The Odin Project.
The intent of this project is to review and practice basic HTML formatting, as well as getting more familiar with Git and Github.
I am personally using it to try and get more familiar with VSCode (I've been using Atom for forever) as well as practicing writing more useful and nicer commit messages (because my current commit history on other projects are a *mess*).

The project tasks:
- Use an html boilerplate to create a basic html page that will be used as a recipe homepage
- Create a few other html pages with different recipes (making use of lists)
- Link the individual recipe pages on the main homepage
Additional tasks:
- Commit to git every time a significant change has been made
- Update this README to be more fleshed out. c:
